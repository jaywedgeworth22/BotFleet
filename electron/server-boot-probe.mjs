// Kernel of the packaged-server boot wait (see issue #506): poll a freshly
// forked child's /api/health until it either proves its identity, we learn
// some other process owns the port, or the wall-clock budget runs out.
//
// Extracted from electron/main.mjs so the failure modes below can carry
// regression tests without booting Electron (main.mjs is not importable in a
// bare node test — importing it starts the whole app bootstrap).
//
// - The budget is wall-clock and shared by every step: each in-flight probe is
//   aborted at the remaining deadline, so a server that accepts connections
//   but never answers cannot wedge the launcher past its own timeout.
// - ANY HTTP answer on the port proves somebody owns it. Only our own child's
//   identity payload counts as ready; everything else (a 404/503 from an
//   unrelated app, wrong pid, non-JSON body) is reported as a foreign owner
//   immediately instead of burning the rest of the budget re-polling a port
//   we will never win.
// - The expected pid must be read as a GETTER at response time, not captured
//   when the caller forks: Electron's utilityProcess assigns proc.pid on the
//   async `spawn` event, so a value grabbed right after fork() is still
//   undefined and our own freshly-bound child would fail the identity match
//   and be reaped as a "foreign owner" on its very first health answer.
