// One writer at a time for ~/.botfleet/config.json, across processes.
//
// Two OS processes write that file: the harness server (server/config.ts's
// saveConfig) and the packaged Electron main process (the auto-updater's
// recordAutomaticCheck and the boot-time credential migrations in main.mjs).
// A second harness can appear too -- the packaged app forks its own when it
// cannot attach to the always-on one -- and it inherits the same data dir.
// Every one of them does a whole-file read-modify-write.  Temp-file-then-
// rename already makes each write atomic, so a reader sees the old file or
// the new one and never a torn one, but it does nothing for the lost-update
// race: a Settings save that lands between another writer's read and its
// rename is replaced by that writer's stale snapshot and silently reverts.
// (PR #251 review, board a2a3a586.)
//
// This module is the one door every writer goes through.  `updateConfigFile`
// takes an advisory lock, reads the file, hands the parsed object to the
// caller's `mutate`, writes the result atomically, and releases.  The lock is
// a sibling `config.json.lock` created with O_EXCL -- atomic on macOS, Linux
// and Windows -- holding the owner's pid, a timestamp and a random token.
//
// Two rules keep it safe without anything POSIX does not offer:
//
//   1. No process ever removes or replaces another process's live lock.  A
//      lock left behind by a crashed, released-but-stuck, or overrun holder
//      is TAKEN OVER in place, and only by one waiter: taking over generation
//      R means first winning `config.json.lock.takeover.<R>` with O_EXCL,
//      then renaming a file holding the taker's own record over the lock.
//      Only one waiter can win a given generation, and nothing but that
//      winner can replace a stale R (its holder is dead, gave up, or is past
//      its lease and by rule 2 no longer touches it), so the rename never
//      lands on a fresh lock and nothing is ever deleted out from under one.
//   2. A holder acts on its lock -- writes through it, or unlinks it on
//      release -- only inside its usable lease, `staleMs` less a margin.  A
//      peer may take the lock over only once the full `staleMs` is out, so
//      inside the usable lease nothing else can replace the generation and
//      the holder's own by-name unlink still refers to it.  Past the lease
//      the holder leaves the lock alone and its fence refuses the write.
//
// Readers never need the lock: the rename keeps reads consistent on their
// own.  It lives under electron/ rather than shared/ because the packaged app
// ships only electron/** (electron-builder.yml `files`); the server imports
// it from here and its esbuild bundle inlines it.  Dependency-free on
// purpose: the packaged app carries no node_modules, so `proper-lockfile` and
// friends are not an option on the Electron side.  The server's TypeScript
// sees it through config-file-lock.d.mts.
