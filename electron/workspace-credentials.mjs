 *
 * "" must never drop a stored secret. The packaged app's external-secret
 * save path writes an empty tombstone into config.json on EVERY credential
 * commit (the real value goes to credentials.bin first), so reading "" as
 * "the user cleared this" deleted freshly saved keys at the next boot.
 * Clearing runs through the desktop shell's credential:set handler, which
 * removes the entry from the store directly before persisting the same
 * tombstone — so there is no "" case in which the store should lose data.
 * Running twice is a no-op, and nothing is lost if a boot dies between the
 * two writes — the caller persists credentials BEFORE rewriting config, so
 * the worst case re-runs the same overwrite.
 *
 * Inputs are treated as immutable; the changed flags tell the caller which
 * file(s) actually need rewriting. Non-string junk in a field is left for
 * the server's schema to reject rather than silently destroyed here. */
