#   - unquiesce is the recovery action that releases runtime admission after an

#   - prepare and apply --stage act on a stage, not on the checkout's HEAD, so
#     the shortcut would make them silently do nothing.
#   - a --target (or BOTFLEET_UPDATE_TARGET) other than origin/main asks for a
#     different commit than the one this check compares against.
#   - --progress / --run-id is the harness's detached run
#     (server/update-control.ts).  It waits for the progress file the updater
#     writes and settles a run that never writes one as "never started", so
#     that run must not end here without a record.
# Anything not on this allowlist (including --help, --source, --stage) goes to
