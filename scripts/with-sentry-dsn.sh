# Resolve SENTRY_DSN and VITE_SENTRY_DSN for a local packaging run, export
# both, then exec the given command.  electron-builder / Vite inline
# VITE_SENTRY_DSN at build time, so it must be in the environment before
# `pnpm package:mac:local` (or any other package:* script) starts.
#
# Resolution order per name: already-exported environment variable ->
# Infisical (only if the `infisical` CLI is on PATH and already logged in --
# this script never runs `infisical login`) -> the local handoff file
# ~/.secrets/botfleet-sentry.env, read with awk so that only the value
# after the first `NAME=` is ever produced, never the whole `NAME=value`
# row.  A value found for SENTRY_DSN but not VITE_SENTRY_DSN is copied
# across, since they are meant to be the same DSN.
# Never echoes, logs, traces, or otherwise prints a resolved value.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/with-sentry-dsn.sh pnpm package:mac:local
#
# Missing everywhere is not an error: the command still runs, packaged with
# Sentry inert (see src/lib/sentry.ts and server/sentry.ts, both no-op on an
# empty DSN).

# FIRST, before anything can read a secret: kill xtrace.  Invoked as
# `bash -x scripts/with-sentry-dsn.sh ...`, or with xtrace inherited through
# an exported SHELLOPTS, every command substitution and assignment below
# would print the resolved DSN to stderr and into whatever terminal or CI
# log is capturing it.  The braces with stderr discarded hide the trace line
# that `set +x` itself would emit on its way out.
{ set +x; } 2>/dev/null

# xtrace carried in an exported SHELLOPTS comes back in every child shell,
# including the command this script execs, so drop the export attribute as
# well.  A no-op when neither name is exported.
