// Whether a newer TestFlight build of THIS app exists.
//
// Unlike everything else in this package, the source here is not the
// paired Mac — it is a small public manifest the fleet publishes at
// `ai-fleet-coordinator/site/ios-versions.json` (served from
// https://jaywedgeworth22.github.io/ai-fleet-coordinator/ios-versions.json),
// listing the latest TestFlight build per app by bundle id.  A phone checks it
// whether or not it is paired with anything, so it cannot live behind
// `CompanionClient`, which requires a `Connection`.  It gets the same
// treatment anyway: the network call is a thin, injectable fetcher, and the
// comparison it feeds is a pure function tested without one.
