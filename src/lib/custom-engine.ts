// assets (e.g. "/codex-mark.png") that vitest's Node-environment asset
// resolution mishandles cross-platform (a bare "file:///codex-mark.png" is a
// valid-looking POSIX path but an invalid Windows file URL, so importing the
// component tree at all broke the Windows CI job). None of that belongs
// anywhere near this file: it is plain async control flow with no React, no

 * instance id) must never have the deleted one's key replayed into it. That
 * is true, but purging first defeated a DIFFERENT safety check instead —
 * clearing a packaged instance's key PATCHes the live harness
 * (?secretStorage=external), which reloads that provider and settles any
 * bot currently mid-turn on it as no-longer-busy. The DELETE route's own
 * 409 guard ("cannot delete engine while a bot using it is working") reads
 * that same busy flag, so purging first silently defeated it — and if the
 * route then refused the delete anyway (no replacement engine available),
 * the instance was left configured with its key already gone.
 *
 * Deleting first lets the route's busy-bot and no-replacement guards see
 * accurate state and run first, exactly as if no credential existed.  Only
 * once the delete has actually succeeded does the key get purged — the
 * server's own delete handler already drops the live, in-memory override at
 * that point; this purges the encrypted store's copy so a same-named future
 * engine cannot inherit it, matching the same intent the earlier ordering
 * was reaching for. A failed purge is surfaced but does not undo the
 * delete — the visible engine is already gone either way. */
