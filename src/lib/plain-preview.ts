// A sidebar row shows the tail of a conversation in a single truncated line.
// It was showing the raw source: a bot that wrote `**Inventory done.&nbsp;
// Merge not started.**` appeared in the roster as exactly that, asterisks and
// entity and all.  The entity is the worse half — the house copy rule is that
// the six characters `&nbsp;` must never reach a person's eyes, and the
// sidebar was putting them there on every row a bot had formatted.
//
// This is deliberately not a Markdown parser.  A preview needs the words in
// reading order with the punctuation of the source removed, and a parser
// would bring a tree, a renderer, and a dependency to a job that is a dozen
// substitutions.  It errs toward keeping text: a stray asterisk in a filename
// survives, because showing one is much cheaper than eating a word.
