// Horizontal geometry for one chat bubble row.
//
// The rule, in one place: a bubble's width is a function of the transcript's
// width alone.  Nothing that appears beside it may enter that calculation,
// because every bit of it mounts, unmounts and changes width while a thread
// is open:
//
//   * the edit pencil is gated on `!bot.busy`, so it leaves every user
//     message the moment a turn starts and comes back when the turn ends;
//   * Regenerate is gated on `isLastBotText && !bot.busy`, so the newest bot
//     message carries one more button than the ones above it;
//   * the hover timestamp reads "4:39 AM" for today and "8/12 4:39 AM" for
//     any earlier day — about 34px wider — so the messages above a day
//     separator measure differently from the ones below it.
//
// While that chrome sat in the flow beside the bubble it set the bubble's
// used width, and bubbles in one column stopped sharing an edge.  So the
// chrome is out of the flow now: a fixed-width gutter reserves the lane, the
// chrome floats inside it, and the bubble's box never hears about it.  A row
// carries exactly one gutter — leading for the user's own column, trailing
// for a bot's — so nothing sits between a bubble and the edge it aligns to.
//
// Kept as literal strings so Tailwind's scanner sees every class.
