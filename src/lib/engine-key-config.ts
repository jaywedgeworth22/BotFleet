// actually lives in — which half of a save goes through the encrypted store,
// when a blank field means "clear" versus "leave it alone" — are pulled out
// where plain unit tests can exercise them.

 * - The endpoint travels over PATCH, and ONLY when it actually changed.  It
 *   is configuration, not a credential — `/api/config` echoes it back, the
 *   Secrets card shows it, and `credential:set` carries one secret field
 *   anyway.  Re-sending an unchanged one is not merely wasteful: when the
 *   vault manages `<engine>.url` with Write Through off, `/api/config`
 *   refuses any save that names it, so a key-only save would 409 on an
 *   endpoint the operator never touched.
 * - A blank key field means "leave the saved key alone", never "clear it".
 *   `/api/config` never echoes a key back, so an untouched field is blank on
 *   every load; sending `""` would wipe a saved key the moment somebody
 *   changed the endpoint beside it.  Clearing is an explicit action
 *   (`clear: true`), exactly as the Secret Store card treats its client
 *   secret.
 * - An explicit clear goes through the bridge too when there is one, because
 *   the store is where the value actually lives; the bridge's own handler
 *   deletes the entry and writes the same empty tombstone to config.json. */
