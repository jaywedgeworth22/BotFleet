 * The call button lives in the chat header, top right (ChatView mounts <CallButton/>).
 * Owner 2026-09-03: with no voice provider configured it must not be in the header at all,
 * rather than rendered disabled with an explanatory tooltip, which is what it used to do.
 *
 * These are source-level assertions rather than a render test because CallTargetButton pulls in
 * the desktop-capabilities and speech stacks; the guard itself is a single unconditional branch,
 * so pinning its shape and its position relative to the hooks is what actually protects it.
