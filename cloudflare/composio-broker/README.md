# BotFleet connected-apps broker

This Worker keeps the shared Composio project key out of desktop builds. Each
installation receives a random bearer token stored only as a SHA-256 hash in
D1. The Worker gives that installation its own Composio user/session, proxies
MCP traffic, and returns short-lived Connect Links to the local app.

The desktop never receives the project key. Authorization links are returned
only on demand and are never persisted in chat messages.

Deployment for this repository:

1. `pnpm broker:types`
2. `pnpm exec wrangler d1 migrations apply botfleet-composio --remote --config cloudflare/composio-broker/wrangler.jsonc`
3. For an existing Worker, run `pnpm exec wrangler secret put COMPOSIO_API_KEY --config cloudflare/composio-broker/wrangler.jsonc`, then `pnpm broker:deploy`.
4. For the very first deploy, put `COMPOSIO_API_KEY=...` in the ignored `.dev.vars.production` file and run `pnpm exec wrangler deploy --config cloudflare/composio-broker/wrangler.jsonc --secrets-file .dev.vars.production`. Delete the file immediately afterward.

Forks should create their own D1 database and rate-limit namespaces, replace
the IDs in `wrangler.jsonc`, deploy under their own Worker name, and set
`OMB_COMPOSIO_BROKER_URL` in their packaged build. Running only the local
server with a Composio project key remains the no-Cloudflare self-host path.

Production `wrangler.jsonc` vars set `REGISTRATION_MODE` to `closed` so strangers
cannot `POST /v1/installations` on the shared `workers.dev` Worker.  Existing
installations keep working.  Set it back to `open` only for a controlled bootstrap.

Session upgrade attempts persist on the existing D1 `installations` row
(`session_upgrade_attempted`).  Apply migration `0002_session_upgrade.sql` before
or with the next `pnpm broker:deploy`.
