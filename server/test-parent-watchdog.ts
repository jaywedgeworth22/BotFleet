// A vitest worker that gets SIGKILLed (the timeout-under-load scenario that
// left six ~4.4 GB harness processes running with parent pid 1 on 2026-09-12,
// after their worker died mid-suite) never runs another line of JS on the
// way out, so nothing ever signals this process — its own `afterAll`,
// `waitForExit`, and the process-`exit` guard in server/testing/cleanup.ts
// are all just as dead as the worker. The only way this process can still
// die with its test is to notice its parent is gone and act on its own.
//
// Gated by the caller on the BOTFLEET_TEST_CHILD marker (see
// server/testing/cleanup.ts's spawnDetached): the always-on launchd harness
// (com.jay.botfleet-server) never sets it, so this module changes nothing
// about production behavior, where the parent legitimately is launchd for
// the whole life of the process.
