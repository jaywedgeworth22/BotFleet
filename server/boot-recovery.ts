// One coordinator for every way a turn can come back after the process
// stopped.  Before this, two independent paths re-dispatched work at boot and
// neither knew what the other had done:
//
//   - `recoverInflightTurn` fired 2.5 s after boot for EVERY bot whose
//     `inflightThreadId` survived, all at once, with no cap — and a graceful
//     SIGTERM was indistinguishable from a crash, so every ordinary restart
//     re-spent a full CLI turn per busy bot (audit HS18);
//   - `resumeInterruptedChatTurns` re-dispatched the turns a forced update had
//     interrupted, from a snapshot written before the restart, and could land
//     on a thread the timer above was about to take (audit HS20).
//
// The rules this module encodes:
//
//   1. The question is not "did the process die mid-turn" — a clean SIGTERM
//      and a crash answer that identically.  It is "can the harness PROVE the
//      provider never saw this prompt", decided by the same classifier the
//      drivers use for a mid-run resume (server/resume-recovery.ts).  Only a
//      `before-accept` turn is sent again; an `after-accept` or `unknown` one
//      continues the provider's own session, or says so in the thread and
//      waits for the person.
//   2. A graceful stop RECORDS what it interrupted, and classifies it while
//      the evidence is freshest, so the next boot acts deliberately instead
//      of inferring from a marker that looks identical to a crash.
//   3. A thread whose last persisted event says the turn already finished is
//      never resumed.  The marker is a crash hint, not evidence.
//   4. A resume that failed terminally is remembered, so the next boot does
//      not retry it forever — only new user input clears it.
//   5. Resumes go out staggered, with a concurrency cap and a total cap that
//      is logged, so a restart never becomes a retry storm (owner ruling,
//      2026-09-22).
//
// The on-disk record is a versioned object, not a bare array, so the work
// that restores a person's queued steer/channel follow-ups across a restart
// (upstream keeps them as `chat_followups` rows) can add its own field here
// without a migration.
//
// Everything here is pure or file-local so it carries tests without booting a
// harness; server/index.ts owns the wiring.
