// module for the DSN instead of carrying a build-time copy.
//
// Two rules hold everywhere in here.  The kill switch is explicit — a DSN
// with no `enabled` flag reports, and only a stored `false` stops it, so
// nothing ever goes quiet without saying why.  And the public key half of a
// DSN never reaches a log line, a status field, or a broadcast frame; only
// the ingest host and the project id do.
