// One builder for the system prompt of every turn, so the direct lane and
// the room lane assemble the same shape and every driver receives the same
// two halves.  The builder is pure: the call site reads memory, selects
// skills, resolves computers, and hands in strings.  This module orders
// them, drops the empty ones, measures each section, and splits the prompt
// at the volatile boundary.
//
// The boundary is a property of the section, never of the driver.  A
// section is volatile when its text legitimately differs between two turns
// of one live conversation: memory, because a bot writes MEMORY.md
// mid-conversation; mentions, which describe the message being sent right
// now; outstanding teammate work and recent work (upstream sections that
// BotFleet may adopt later), which settle or relabel while the person keeps
// talking.  Everything else is the stable half: the bytes a provider's
// cached prefix, or a spawned CLI's session contract, must keep identical.
//
// Before this split every one of those sections lived inside the single
// system string.  Saving a memory changed that string, which changed the
// Claude driver's spawn contract, which relaunched the CLI, and the
// provider then re-uploaded the entire conversation at the cache-write
// rate.  A tagged teammate did the same on every mention turn.  Ported
// from OpenMausBot `server/system-prompt.ts` (upstream PR #1758).
