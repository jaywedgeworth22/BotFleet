// Antigravity driver — Google's `agy` CLI in headless one-shot print mode
// (`agy --print --output-format stream-json`), modeled on claude.ts but fully
// self-contained. Per-turn CLI process; the conversation continues across
// turns via `--conversation <id>` (the resumeCursor is agy's conversation_id).
// Verified against agy 1.1.12.
//
// Unlike claude, print mode has NO interactive permission hook: there is no
// per-action broker here.  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (fullAuto)
// approves everything.  Real per-action approval cards are a future path via
// native ACP (agy issue #31), which would reuse acp/core.ts like grok/gemini.
//
// `--mode` is NOT the permission switch, and an earlier version of this file
// said it was.  agy 1.1.26 `--help` lists "--mode  Set the agent execution
// mode for this session (accept-edits, plan)" and, separately, "--sandbox
// Run in a sandbox with terminal restrictions enabled".  Whether a terminal
// command needs approval is agy's own Tool Execution Policy — a global
// setting this driver does not pass and cannot override, reported per session
// as `permission_mode` on the init event.  Measured on this Mac with agy
// 1.1.26: `--mode accept-edits` with no bypass reports `always-proceed` and
// then RUNS `run_command`.  Under agy's shipped default the same spawn is
// refused — a probe with a config-free HOME reported `request-review` and
// agy's own stderr said the tool "required the \"command\" permission that
// headless mode cannot prompt for, so it was auto-denied", ending the turn
// CANCELED (2026-09-18).
//
// So a turn that holds host control — the person's own desktop — is spawned
// WITHOUT the bypass however the instance is configured, AND is stopped at
// the init event unless agy reports a policy that asks.  Nothing in print
// mode can put a card in front of anyone, so a turn that does not start is
// the only guarantee this engine can actually keep.
//
// fullAuto is OFF unless the person turns it on in Settings › Engines.  The
// bypass skips BotFleet's permission broker entirely — no card, no
// destructive/sensitive guard, no decision-log row — so it is an opt-in the
// Engines row spells out, never a default a fresh bot inherits.
//
// Computer use: agy has no per-turn MCP flag, so the bot's computer (cloud
// box / Local VM / VPS / local computer) is mounted by upserting keys into the
// global `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` before each spawn — see
// ensureAntigravityMcp below.

// ── the mount lease (DR4) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// agy's MCP file is machine-global, so a turn that MOUNTS a computer into it
// must exclude every other Antigravity turn for its child's whole lifetime —
// otherwise a second turn's agy could pick up the first turn's tools and, in
// their env, its box or control tokens.  That part has not changed.
//
// What changed is who has to wait.  The lease used to be one module-global
// promise taken unconditionally, so a turn with NO computer at all — the
// overwhelming majority — still serialized behind whatever else was running,
// for as long as that turn lasted — then up to 11 minutes.  Two bots on
// Antigravity could not answer at the same time.
//
// It is a reader/writer lease now, per config path:
//   • a turn that mounts nothing and has nothing of ours to strip takes the
//     SHARED side — any number of those run at once, because none of them
//     writes the file and none of them can inherit a mount that does not
//     exist;
//   • a turn that mounts a computer, or that has to strip a leftover
//     `botfleet-*` key, takes the EXCLUSIVE side: it waits for the readers
//     already running to finish AND locks everyone else out until its child
//     is gone.
//
// That keeps today's isolation guarantee intact.  The obvious cheaper fixes
// do not: releasing the lease once the child has "read" the config assumes a
// read time nobody has measured (agy may start an MCP server lazily, at the
// first tool call), and skipping the lease outright for computer-less turns
// would let one start WHILE a mount is installed, which is exactly the
// token-crossing this lease exists to prevent.
//
// TODO(DR4): a MOUNTING turn still holds the file for its child's whole
// lifetime — up to the turn's hard ceiling (`promptTimeoutMs`, 11 minutes by
// default), though a silent child is now stopped by the idle windows long
// before that and a timeout is never relaunched.  Shortening that needs one measured fact nobody has yet: WHEN
// does `agy` read `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`?  If it reads once at
// startup, the exclusive hold can end at the init event and mounting turns
// would stop excluding each other for minutes.  If it re-reads lazily — say,
// the first time the model calls a computer tool — an early release would
// hand one turn another turn's tools and box token, so the hold must stay.
// Measure it against a real `agy` (watch the file with fs events across a
// turn that calls a tool late) before changing anything here.  Neither the
// code, the comments below, nor agy 1.1.26's embedded docs answer it.
