// The driver-owned tool loop for chat-completions engines.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  A CLI engine runs its own model-to-tool rounds
// inside one turn and emits exactly one `turn.started` / `turn.completed`
// pair per user turn.  Every one of the harness's `turn.completed`
// consumers — the watchdog, the Sentry span closer, the routine receipt,
// the repeat detector, the room waiter, the queue drains, the SSE
// broadcast, the usage fold — was written against that shape.  The HTTP
// lane used to break it: each inner round was its own `turn.completed`
// carrying a `"tool_calls: "` prefix, five consumers guarded on the
// prefix and six did not, and every exit that was not "the model finally
// answered" — the round cap, the round timer, a rejected dispatch —
// emitted no terminal event at all, so the bot stayed busy until the
// twenty-minute stall watchdog fired.
//
// Moving the loop in here makes an HTTP turn indistinguishable from a CLI
// turn at the harness boundary, and it does it structurally rather than by
// adding guards:
//
//   1. ONE terminal event, from ONE `finally`.  Nothing else in this file
//      emits `turn.completed`.  No exit — round cap, wall clock, request
//      timeout, provider error, abort, suspend, a host that throws, an
//      unexpected throw — can leave a turn unsettled.  The exit union
//      below is CLOSED and both lookup tables are `Record<TurnLoopExit, …>`,
//      so a new exit cannot be added without a stop reason, an ok flag,
//      and (in loop.test.ts) a test row.
//   2. The messages array lives here and is only appended to, so the
//      prefix the provider already saw stays byte-identical across rounds.
//   3. Usage sums across rounds and is carried on the terminal event, on
//      the error path as well as the success path.
//   4. `item.completed` for a tool carries the REAL outcome, emitted after
//      the host returns — never `ok: true` for work the driver did not do.
//   5. The turn's abort signal is checked between rounds and raced inside
//      every tool call, so Stop terminates from any point in the loop.
