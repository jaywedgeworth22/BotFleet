// instead of being re-derived (or forgotten) per suite.
//
// A third failure mode lives here too: a suite that spawns the real harness
// (server/index.ts) and then never gets to run its own cleanup at all — a
// vitest worker SIGKILLed on timeout under load (six ~4.4 GB harness
// processes were found orphaned with parent pid 1 on 2026-09-12, right after
// a run this loaded) leaves that child running forever, because Node never
// kills a process's children just because the process itself exited.
// `spawnDetached` and the exit guard below are the two defenses that live in
// this module for it; server/test-parent-watchdog.ts is the third, for the
// case where nothing in this process ever gets to run again either.

 *    (this test worker) is gone and there is nobody left to send it a signal
 *    at all — the backstop for a parent that is SIGKILLed outright.
 *  - The child is tracked for the exit guard above, and untracked as soon as
 *    it actually closes.
 *
 * Windows gets none of the process-group handling (there is no POSIX
 * process group there — see server/procs.ts's own win32 branch) but still
 * gets the env markers and tracking, matching what `waitForExit` already
