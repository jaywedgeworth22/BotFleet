// Static tool catalog for HTTP drivers (MiniMax, OpenAI-compatible).
//
// CLI drivers (Claude, Codex, DSH, Droid, Pi, ACP engines) mount MCP
// servers at turn time and discover tools at runtime, so they do not need a
// static catalog.  HTTP drivers cannot, so the harness has to hand the model
// a tool list on the wire.
//
// This file no longer OWNS any definition.  `server/tools/registry.ts` holds
// one record per tool and both lanes render it, so the HTTP catalog and the
// MCP catalog cannot drift the way they did when each lane wrote its own
// schema.  What remains here is the shim that maps the dispatch's
// `integrations` object onto a registry gate; it disappears when the last
// caller moves to `httpToolDefinitions` directly.

import type { SendTurnInput } from "./contracts.ts";

/** Build the tool catalog for an HTTP-driver turn.  Returns an empty array
 * when no integration surfaces are enabled, so the driver hands the model a
 * plain chat request and the loop is a no-op.
 *
 * The dispatch has already gated `integrations.agents` on
 * `commsDepth < MAX_COMMS_DEPTH` and the driver's `agentsMcp` capability by
 * the time it gets here — if either is false the object is absent and the
 * model is offered nothing.  A caller with the real numbers to hand can pass
 * `gate` instead and let the registry apply the ceiling itself. */
