// The harness's in-process permission broker.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.  Approvals on the CLI lane are a round trip through
// the engine: the agent emits `request.opened`, the harness folds it into a
// card (or answers it from auto mode), and the person's verdict goes back
// through `adapter.respondToRequest`.  Everything that makes that trip
// trustworthy — auto-approve, always-allow, the destructive and sensitive
// guards, the unattended block, auto-review, the decision log, the
// notification, the watchdog's waiting-on-human exemption — hangs off those
// two events and nothing else.
//
// The HTTP lane had no such round trip.  A chat-completions driver runs its
// own tool rounds in-process, so there was no engine to ask and no
// `request.opened` to fold: a MiniMax bot simply ran whatever the model
// asked for.  This broker is the missing half.  It publishes a REAL
// `request.opened` on the same bus and returns a promise that settles when
// the answer comes back, so every one of those behaviours applies to an
// HTTP bot for the first time — not by reimplementing them here, but by
// reaching the exact fold the CLI lane already reaches.
//
// Three rules hold this together:
//
//   1. ONE indirection at resolution.  `respond()` returns `null` for every
//      requestId this broker does not own, and the caller falls through to
//      `adapter.respondToRequest`.  A CLI request therefore takes the path
//      it always took, byte for byte.
//   2. Every ask settles EXACTLY once.  Approve, deny, interrupt, turn
//      teardown, dispose — whichever arrives first wins and the rest are
//      no-ops.  A pending ask that never settles is a hung turn and an
//      un-answerable card, which is the failure this file is most careful
//      about.
//   3. An abandoned ask is a DENY.  `"unavailable"` means the action never
//      ran, so a stopped turn can never leave behind an approval nobody
//      gave.  Fail-closed is the only safe direction here.
