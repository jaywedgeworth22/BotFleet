// The harness's one tool registry.
//
// Before this file a tool existed three times: once as an MCP `inputSchema`
// in `drivers/agents-proxy.ts`, once as a chat-completions `parameters`
// block in `turn-tools.ts`, and once as an endpoint body in `index.ts`.
// Nothing held the three together, so they drifted — `list_bots` offered a
// bot its own row on one lane and not the other, and hid `busy` on one lane
// and not the other, within a single PR.  A record here is the single
// description of a tool, and each lane RENDERS it rather than restating it.
//
// This module is deliberately dependency-free: it imports nothing from
// `server/index.ts` and nothing that reaches it.  `agents-proxy.ts` is
// spawned as a separate process inside a bot's agent, so anything it can
// see has to be importable without starting a harness.  `registry.test.ts`
// asserts the ban rather than trusting it.
//
// A record carries:
//   - `schema`      the ONE JSON Schema for the tool's arguments
//   - `surfaces`    which lanes may offer it (MCP, HTTP, or both)
//   - `gate`        a pure predicate over one turn's context
//   - `sideEffect`  "read" or "write" — what a permission broker needs
//   - `settles`     whether the tool returns inline or ends the turn on a card
//   - `promptFragment`  the sentence the system prompt may use for it, so
//                   prompt copy cannot outlive the tool (consumed in PR 5)
//   - `approval`    optional ask policy (consumed when the broker lands)
