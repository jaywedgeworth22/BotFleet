// The harness's tool executor for one driver-owned turn.
//
// A driver that declares `capabilities.toolLoop` runs its own model-to-tool
// rounds and asks this host to actually run each call.  The host is where
// caller identity lives: `botId` and `threadId` are baked into the closure
// at dispatch, never read from the model's arguments, because this lane
// bypasses the loopback + COMMS_TOKEN hop the MCP lane uses and there is no
// second place to check who is asking.  `AgentToolCallContext` is therefore
// constructible ONLY here — nothing else in the process assembles one.
//
// The host owns no tool bodies.  `server/tools/registry.ts` says which tools
// exist and what they look like on each lane; `server/tools/agents.ts` says
// what they do, with every dependency passed in.  This file is the join:
// gate the catalog, look the call up in it, ASK IF THE RECORD SAYS TO, and
// run it with the turn's identity.
//
// That ask is the one policy decision here, and it is deliberately thin: the
// host reads `approval` off the registry record and hands the question to
// the broker.  It does not decide the answer — auto mode, always-allow, the
// guards and the unattended block all live in the same fold a CLI engine's
// request reaches.  A tool with no `approval` record never asks at all.
//
// `execute` never throws.  Every failure comes back as `{ kind: "error" }`
// with a string the MODEL reads, so a broken tool is one more thing the
// agent can reason about rather than a dead turn.
