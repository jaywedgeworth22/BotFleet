// The transactional Mac updater (`scripts/update-botfleet-mac.mjs`) stops
// this harness and quits the desktop app partway through, so it can be a
// child of neither: a child of the harness dies with the harness, and a
// child of the app dies with the app.  It therefore runs DETACHED, as a
// one-shot launchd job in the same GUI domain this harness runs in, and the
// only channel back is a progress file it writes as it goes plus the log
// launchd captures for it.  That is also why the status survives a restart:
// the run outlives us, so on boot we read the same files back and carry on
// describing a run we did not start in this process.
//
// Everything a test wants to drive — git, the launcher, the clock, the
// process check — arrives as an injected dependency.  The real ones are
// built in `createUpdateControl` from the environment.

 *     install.

 * installed, so it cannot describe anything newer than it.  `installedAt`
 * dates a packaged build; a source run has none, and the last run's finish is
 * the same boundary.  `start()` confirms with `git merge-base` before it
