// A room round that arrives while its bot is busy elsewhere.
//
// One turn per bot at a time is a hard rule — two provider processes for one
// bot means interleaved token spend and an interrupt that reaches only one of
// them.  But the rule was enforced by *dropping* the round: the room got
// "Director is busy in another conversation — skipped this round" and the
// work was simply gone.  A person watching a channel reads that as the bot
// refusing, and the only recovery is to say it again.
//
// So a busy bot's round waits here instead, and runs when the bot settles.
// The same shape as `steer-queue.ts`, with the differences a room forces:
//
//   - keyed by (thread, bot), because two members of one room can be waiting
//     on two different bots at the same time;
//   - one entry per key, because a round is a request to speak, not a
//     message to deliver — asking twice does not mean speaking twice;
//   - bounded and dated, because a bot that never frees up must not grow a
//     queue forever, and a round nobody remembers asking for should not
//     surface an hour later.
