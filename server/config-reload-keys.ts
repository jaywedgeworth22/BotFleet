// the live `cfg`, never by a driver, so flipping a provider toggle in
// Settings must not rebuild the fleet.  A provider turned OFF is still a
// revocation, though: the turns that hold it are interrupted one by one
// (see `disabledComputerProviders` / `turnUsesComputerProvider`) while every
// other turn keeps running.
