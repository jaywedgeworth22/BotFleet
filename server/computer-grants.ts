 * both a remote desktop and this machine therefore got exactly one of them,
 * silently, with the remote always winning. That is a routing decision the
 * agent should be making per task, not one the harness should make once.

 * Granting only the VM means only the VM — there is no fallback to this

 *
 * Naming is deliberately conservative. With exactly one computer the server is

 * surface, prompt, and allow-list they always have. Distinct names appear only
 * once a second computer is actually mounted.
