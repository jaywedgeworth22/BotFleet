## What BotFleet Adds

These are features this fork layered on after OpenMausBot.  **All of them are in testing** — they run in daily use on this fleet, they are not a finished product surface, and they can still change.  Card-by-card provenance lives at **[botfleet.app](https://botfleet.app)**.

### Messaging, companion, and desktop

- **Always-on iMessage relay** — a host daemon plus LaunchAgents keep bot group chats in Messages.app wired to the BotFleet backend in both directions while the relay is running.
- **iOS companion (public TestFlight)** — pairing, universal links on `botfleet.app`, App Groups, thread tabs, unread Live Activities, and display-aware transcript windows.  Alerts are SSE plus local notifications while the companion is open; a killed app does not yet wake.  iPad still runs in compatibility mode.
- **Nested conversations under channels** — renameable task threads live under their channel, can be moved, searched, and collapsed, with a custom word for "room" if you want one.
- **Chat bubble and request-ID copy** — click a bubble to copy its text; hover and right-click also copy Request ID or Message ID.
- **macOS menu bar tray** — a menu-bar extra keeps BotFleet reachable while the window is hidden.
- **Studio light default** — first visit uses Studio (light).  Dark and System Auto are explicit picker rows.  Code fences use a light Shiki theme so they stay readable on the default skin.
- **Always-on harness attach** — the desktop app attaches to an already-running BotFleet harness instead of forking a second one.

### Engines, failover, and telemetry

- **Native DeepSeek driver** — DeepSeek models join Claude, Codex, Cursor, Grok, Gemini, and Antigravity via a native driver plus the dsh bot, with in-app rates and token pricing.
- **Gemini and Antigravity engines** — including Gemini 3.8 Flash, full tool loading, and local computer dispatch on those harnesses after opt-in.
- **Multi-tier model fallbacks** — first, second, and third choice models per bot.  Quota, usage-cap, and session-limit chips fail over to the saved chain automatically, including after tools already ran and in rooms.  Other streamed error paths are still in review.
- **Elapsed turn timer** — a live timer on the in-progress turn, plus duration on completed activity runs.
- **Usage telemetry** — live token consumption (prompt, completion, cache hits) and model costs stream to a Usage Monitor instance you configure, with project and repo classification.  Working-directory classification uses the folder **basename only**, never the full path.
- **Provider marks and picker filtering** — official-style marks for Grok, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini/Antigravity, and others; unconfigured models stay out of the picker.

### Fleet ops, memory, and automation

- **Fleet Recall** — bots search and contribute to a shared memory store instead of a private hash-proxy index.
- **Fleet MCP tools** — list and answer approvals, `open_app`, routines, webhooks, decision-log tools, and idempotent sends for external MCP clients.
- **Multi-repo channels and file links** — a channel can attach several repositories with automatic context injection.  Local file links open in the default Mac app, or reveal in Finder on Option-click.
- **Resource-threshold triggers** — sample local disk, RAM/swap, and optional CPU load and enqueue the same kind of task a routine would when a threshold is crossed.
- **TryCloudflare, Tailscale, and custom domains** — a free `*.trycloudflare.com` URL from Settings, Tailscale MagicDNS for phone linking, or a Cloudflare token for a custom domain.  Custom webhook ingress can sit on its own domain with token validation.
- **Mid-task crash and restart recovery** — interrupted turns and mid-flight tool executions are detected on boot so work can resume instead of sitting stuck.
- **One-command TestFlight ship** — signing, archive, and upload from the Mac build environment.

None of the items above are "done."  Treat them as a testing list.

## From OpenMausBot

BotFleet is a friendly fork of **[OpenMausBot](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot)** by Milind Soni and contributors.

**Upstream source (prominent on purpose):** [https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot)

When we forked, that project already shipped the core app this repo still runs on:

- **Bring-your-own engines** — bots run on `claude`, `codex`, and `grok` CLIs installed on your machine (your logins and subscriptions, no proxy in the middle), with a custom-binary override in Settings → Engines.  Cursor and OpenCode engines were already in the box.
- **Local-first harness** — one small server on `127.0.0.1` owns every bot process.  Transcripts, keys, and events live on disk, not a vendor cloud.
- **Per-bot model picker** — a provider rail, defaults marked, unavailable providers dimmed with the reason.  Switch a bot's model mid-conversation.
- **A computer per bot** — cloud Linux desktop (Box), isolated Local VM, or this computer after explicit opt-in, with a live screen preview and browser takeover.
- **Approval cards** — shell commands, file edits, and questions surface as Allow / Deny / answer-in-chat.  A permission broker turns risky actions into decisions you make.
- **Connected apps** — a Composio marketplace (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Linear, and hundreds more).  OAuth once, every bot can use them as tools.
- **Messaging-app roster** — pin, mark unread, edit profile, duplicate, copy conversation ID, hide, delete.  Bots behave like contacts.
- **Keys once** — paste credentials in App Settings; they persist locally and the provider fleet hot-reloads.  The UI only ever sees "configured" flags.
- **Channels** — Work, Personal, and each project in separate channels without cloning bots.  Each channel has its own transcript, shared instructions, working folder, responder rules, and roster.
- **Team import from one Markdown file** — browse outcome-driven teams (BotMRR), review, then create bots, Chief of Staff, channels, playbooks, connector checklist, and suggested routines.  File or GitHub URL import too.  Packages never carry credentials, conversations, permissions, memory, or computer access.
- **Voice** — ElevenLabs TTS on any reply, per-bot voices, and a macOS call mode that uses on-device dictation.
- **Streaming tool-run chips**, native macOS dictation from the composer mic, cursor mascots, and screenshots of the bot's work folded into the transcript.
- **MCP control plane** — a stdio MCP server for Claude Desktop / Cursor to inspect bots and channels, page transcripts, create work, wait, switch models, and interrupt.  It does not expose approval grants, deletion, arbitrary settings, credentials, or computer lifecycle.
- **Routines and webhooks** — one-shot or weekday schedules, plus a dedicated webhook receiver on `127.0.0.1:8800`.
- **Desktop shells** — packaged macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu 24.04 apps with an embedded harness.

See the [OpenMausBot repository](https://github.com/milind-soni/OpenMausBot) for the current upstream project, including later changes this fork has not pulled.

## Quick start

**Released builds ([latest](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/releases/latest)):** the harness server is embedded, so no separate server setup is required.  Desktop `package.json` is currently 0.1.38; this page always points at the latest packaged assets rather than a frozen tag.

| | Download | Install |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS** (Apple silicon) | [BotFleet-0.1.38-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/releases/latest/download/BotFleet-0.1.38-arm64.dmg) | Drag it to Applications, open it.  Signed with the BotFleet Developer ID. |
| **macOS** (Intel) | [BotFleet-0.1.38-x64.dmg](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/releases/latest/download/BotFleet-0.1.38-x64.dmg) | Same app, built for Intel Macs. |
| **Windows** (x64) | Not published yet | The Windows installer is built by the release workflow but no Windows build has shipped.  Watch the [releases page](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/releases) or build from source below. |
| **Ubuntu 24.04** (x64) | Not published yet | Ubuntu packages are built by the release workflow but no Ubuntu build has shipped.  See the [Ubuntu Desktop guide](docs/linux-desktop.md) to build one from source. |

In-app **Check for updates** needs the `latest-mac.yml` feed and zip artifacts on the release; the current release carries DMGs only, so updates are manual until the release workflow publishes a full asset set.

See the [Ubuntu Desktop guide](docs/linux-desktop.md) for installation, capabilities, and troubleshooting.

**From source:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet && cd BotFleet
pnpm install

pnpm dev:server    # harness server → 127.0.0.1:8799
pnpm dev           # app → http://127.0.0.1:5199
pnpm dev:desktop   # Electron shell; keep the two commands above running
```

Requirements: **macOS, Windows, or Ubuntu 24.04 x64**, **Node 24+**, **pnpm**, and at least one bot CLI — [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code),
[`codex`](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [`grok`](https://x.ai/cli) — installed and logged in.  They appear
in the model picker automatically.

Package the desktop application:

```sh
pnpm package:mac      # macOS: DMG + ZIP; requires Swift/Xcode tools
pnpm package:win      # Windows: installer + ZIP
pnpm package:linux    # Ubuntu x64: .deb + AppImage + verified CUA runtime
```

### Desktop capability status

| Capability | macOS | Ubuntu 24.04 Xorg | Ubuntu 24.04 Wayland |
|---|---|---|---|
| Packaged app, embedded harness, local bot CLIs | Supported | Beta | Beta |
| Composio and Box/cloud computers | Supported | Beta | Beta |
| Explicit preview-only local screen capture | Supported | Beta | Beta |
| Bot control of this computer | Supported | Beta, explicit opt-in | Disabled: Wayland safety gate |
| Native on-device dictation | Supported | Planned | Planned |

The Linux preview is user-initiated and never enables local bot control or Auto routing.  On Xorg, the reviewed Cua Driver 0.19.3 runtime starts only after explicit opt-in and without its full-screen cursor overlay.  On Wayland the app never starts it and clears legacy opt-ins while that real-seat safety gate remains unresolved.  Chat, preview, Cloud, and Local VM remain available on both sessions.  See the [Ubuntu Desktop guide](docs/linux-desktop.md) and tracking issues [#29](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/issues/29), [#345](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/issues/345), and [#113](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/issues/113).

The Linux packager downloads only the tag-pinned upstream archive during the build, verifies its size, SHA-256, complete member allowlist, and inner executable hashes, then packages only the CLI and cursor-theme sidecar.  The installed app never downloads or self-updates native automation code.  Cua's MIT notice, Inter's SIL OFL, a generated third-party license report, and a CycloneDX inventory ship with the runtime.  See [`third_party/cua-driver/`](third_party/cua-driver/) for the reviewed provenance record.

These credentials are optional — local chat works without them.  Paste a key once in **App Settings** (gear in the sidebar footer) when you want to enable its integration:

| Credential | What it enables | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| Composio project key (`ak_…`) | Connect Gmail, GitHub, Slack, Notion, and other apps to your bots | [BotFleet Composio setup](docs/composio.md) |
| Box API key | Give bots an isolated remote Linux computer with a desktop and terminal | [Box API key guide](https://docs.ascii.dev/box/api-keys) |
| ElevenLabs key | Read replies aloud, and call your bots | [ElevenLabs API keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys) |

Composio and Box are third-party services with their own accounts and terms.  Box is a paid service after its trial, and using a cloud computer may incur charges.

```sh
pnpm typecheck     # app + server
pnpm test          # unit, driver, API, and desktop capability tests
pnpm build         # typecheck + production build
pnpm check:electron # syntax-check Electron main/preload files
pnpm package:win   # Windows installer + zip → release/
pnpm package:linux # Ubuntu x64 .deb + AppImage → release/
```

### Routines, webhooks, and resource triggers

Routines can run once or on selected weekdays, using either a bot's configured model/computer or the Cloud VM runner.  Webhook triggers are independent from schedules but reuse the same queued task executor and calendar receipts.  Resource triggers sample local disk, RAM/swap, and optional CPU load while BotFleet is running and enqueue the same kind of task when a threshold is crossed.

BotFleet starts a webhook-only receiver on `127.0.0.1:8800` by default (or one port above `OMB_PORT`).  Set `OMB_WEBHOOK_PORT` to choose another port.  A webhook secret is shown once when the trigger is created or rotated.  Bearer authentication is recommended so the secret stays out of request URLs and most access logs; a single capability URL remains available for senders that cannot configure headers.  The receiver exposes only `/health` and secret `/hooks/...` endpoints; it never exposes the app's broader API.  BotFleet must remain running to accept a delivery.  For public internet delivery and mobile app access, BotFleet offers **TryCloudflare (Free URL)** integration in Settings.

### Remote Access, Mobile App, and Webhooks

To connect the BotFleet iOS app or receive public internet webhooks while the app is running on your Mac, you have three options:

1. **TryCloudflare (Free URL)** (recommended for webhooks): BotFleet can spin up a Cloudflare Tunnel and give you a `*.trycloudflare.com` URL.  Toggle it on in Settings.  No Cloudflare account or custom domain is required.
2. **Tailscale**: for phone linking without public webhooks, Tailscale is supported out of the box via MagicDNS.
3. **Custom Domain**: bring your own Cloudflare API token to route traffic through a custom domain (Cloudflare Zero Trust plus DNS).

See [MCP server setup and tool reference](docs/mcp-server.md) for the stdio control plane.

## Status

Early but real — the loop works end to end: message → bot → streamed reply → tools → approvals → computer use.  macOS has the primary released build; Windows and Ubuntu packages are produced by CI but have not shipped yet.  Ubuntu remains a beta with the capability limits above.  Hosted/mobile connectivity is still being built.  Voice needs an ElevenLabs key, and calls are macOS-only for now (they ride the same on-device dictation as the composer mic) — see [`docs/voice-mode.md`](docs/voice-mode.md).

Every BotFleet-layer add-on listed above is in testing.

Contributions welcome — the driver SPI in [`server/contracts.ts`](server/contracts.ts) is deliberately small; adding a provider is one file in [`server/drivers/`](server/drivers/) plus a one-line registration.
