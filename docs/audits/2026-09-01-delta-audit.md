# BotFleet Delta Audit — 1 September 2026

**Seat:** GROK.  **In-repo landing:** Batch 4 + 6 honesty/docs/ops on `grok/delta-audit-fixes`.  **Worktree:** `~/apps/botfleet-grok-delta`.  **Issue:** #22.  **Board:** `9e922f65`.

**Source:** owner-facing docx `BotFleet-Delta-Audit-2026-09-01.docx` (read-only review of `b34ac909` after PR #82).  This markdown is the compact register plus a HEAD note.  It does not replace `docs/audits/2026-08-31-full-stack-audit.md`.

**HEAD seen while landing this file:** `10bfbf6` (`fix(server): trigger model fallback on streamed error messages`, #89).  Newer than the docx baseline `b34ac909`.  #89 narrowed P0-1 further (streamed error text can fail over) but tool `activity` with `tool.ok !== false` still counts as produced.

**Standing product rules:** 3–5 peer bots, no hierarchy.  Light is the first-visit default.  iPhone companion (iPad is compatibility mode).  Two spaces between sentences.  Never push `main`.

## Executive snapshot

BotFleet is a real local-first product.  The honesty gap is between botfleet.app / README / SECURITY.md and what main actually does.  Roughly fifty PRs landed between the 31 Aug audit (`d70325c`) and the docx review (`b34ac909`).  Several advertised-dead features moved.  The Aug 31 P0 is narrower, not gone.

| Bucket | Count | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| P0 remaining | 1 | Model fallbacks.  Error chips and some streamed error text no longer block.  Other activity still does. |
| P1 new | 1 | iOS ATS.  PR #81 set `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` and cleartext-excepted botfleet.app. |
| P1 still open | ~15 | Electron window-open / open-file, Composio open registration, avatarCrop drop, deleteBot ghosts, VM stall lease, Auto pipe-to-shell, CSS Midnight, closed-app push, iOS image paths, client races. |
| P2 cluster | Unchanged+ | Site / README / effort-log / SECURITY.md / pricing / telemetry / layout, plus circular self-fork README. |

Recommended posture from the owner docx: stop adding add-ons.  Close the honesty gap in six short batches.  This seat landed Batch 4 (copy/version/CTA) and Batch 6 (hygiene/SECURITY/effort-log) plus C1/C2 from Batch 5 that this fileset owns.

## Recommended batches (from the owner docx)

1. **Fallbacks actually run (P0).**  Other seat owns `server/index.ts`.  #89 landed streamed-error failover; remaining: ignore tool activity, room turns, harness tests.
2. **PR #81 ATS rollback and iOS truth.**  Other seat owns `ios/project.yml`.  Closed-app push stays a separate project.
3. **Electron trust, for real.**  Other seat owns `electron/main.mjs`.
4. **First-run light, copy, version.**  CSS `@theme` is another seat (`src/styles.css`).  Copy, CTA, roster, provenance, README fork paragraph are this PR.
5. **Data and permissions.**  `deleteBot`, `avatarCrop`, VM stall, Auto-approve are other seats.  Composio C1/C2 are this PR because this fileset owns the broker.
6. **Hygiene.**  Effort-log, SECURITY.md, this audit markdown.  Layout overlay is **follow-up**, not mixed into this unit.

## Already solid — do not "fix"

Loopback Host/Origin gate.  Write-only API-key UI.  Device tokens hashed.  iOS Keychain AfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly.  Linux Wayland host control fail-closed.  Paired `/profile` refuses `autoApprove` / `computer` / `alwaysAllow`.  Sentry project `jays-services/botfleet` exists.
