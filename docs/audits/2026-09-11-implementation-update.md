# BotFleet Audit Implementation Update

Updated 2026-09-11T14:21:19-05:00 (Central Time).

This batch implements 11 of the original 35 findings across five pull requests, plus dependency issue #311.  The other 24 findings remain explicitly tracked below.  The [September 9 audit](2026-09-09-end-to-end-audit.md) and its [original evidence ledger](2026-09-09-findings.json) remain unchanged.  The [structured addendum](2026-09-11-implementation-update.json) preserves a finding-by-finding link to that baseline.

## Implemented Changes

- [PR #313](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/pull/313): Serialize startup/migration and hold process-lifetime ownership before config, providers, SQLite, routines, or webhooks; authenticate desktop attachment with a nonce challenge.  Merged as `1a418e01`.
- [PR #312](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/pull/312): Capture task identity and stable retry keys; replay committed sends safely after task switches; await guarded APNs hydration without background navigation; guard pairing and concurrent SSE changes.  Merged as `cf51b991`.
- [PR #314](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/pull/314): Isolate bot MCP configuration and tool-free one-shot Claude helpers, cache strict-MCP capability probes, and remove duplicated Grok request context.  Merged as `86410c70`.
- [PR #315](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/pull/315): Track the actual turn owner, select healthy fallbacks, retain busy fences until cancellation succeeds, and protect newer setup from stale watchdog grace callbacks.  Awaiting final green review/merge.
- [PR #316](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/pull/316): Update packaging, test, and docs dependencies and adapt the builder schema; validate generated artifacts on clean hosted operating systems.  Contained in this PR.

## Validation And Operational Boundaries

- Full provider and engine `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` gates passed locally (3,491 and 3,490 Vitest tests respectively, plus chained suites).  Subsequent review fixes received focused regression/typecheck checks and fresh hosted matrices; final merge requires green CI.
- iOS passed 248 Swift tests and the final hosted unsigned iOS build.  Local simulator acceptance was unavailable because no usable iOS runtime/destination was installed.  No appearance change or physical-phone acceptance is claimed.
- Automatic [push run 34634018784](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/actions/runs/34634018784) archived and uploaded version 1.0.43 build 202609111834 from `cf51b991`, and Apple verification reached internal TestFlight availability.  [Scheduled run 34634263228](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/actions/runs/34634263228) skipped the already-shipped commit without another upload.  Installation and physical-device acceptance were not performed.
- Claude/Grok focused suites passed 74 tests with one skipped after helper isolation and capability checks on every launch.  Installed native Claude 2.1.266 advertises the required strict-MCP flag; no authentication or inference was exercised.  New review findings also produced regressions for stale hydration, pairing changes, queued continuations, watchdog generation ownership, and Windows fake-CLI portability.
- The dependency update resolves the vulnerable version ranges associated with all 26 alerts in the starting advisory set.  Clean hosted package validation caught an Electron Builder 26 desktop schema change, which was corrected.  The local pnpm store was inconsistent; repeated repair attempts were stopped and owned partial copies moved recoverably to Trash.  Hosted packaging is the validation source for this lane.
- Exact-code native [Windows and unsigned macOS validation run 34634988323](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/actions/runs/34634988323) passed at `5b034a70`, including native helpers, packaged resource/proxy checks, and updater metadata checks.  [PR CI 34634973302](https://github.com/jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet/actions/runs/34634973302) passed all six jobs, including Linux package/DEB/AppImage smoke and safe AppRun search-path checks.  The macOS job also built the docs app with Next 16.3.3.
- All three desktop platforms receive hosted tests.  Artifact-only desktop packaging checks do not publish, sign, notarize, or prove the deployed update feed.
- The last directly inspected runtime checkout was `2246f19e`, preceding these fixes.  No manual runtime restart, paid engine turn, synthetic PagerDuty incident, or Tailscale change was performed.  Normal rollout and deployed acceptance remain outstanding.
- Composio returned HTTP 200 with configured credentials in 12.76 seconds; tool use is still unverified.  Recall status exceeded a 22-second client deadline and an MCP contribution timed out at 300 seconds, while the normal CLI contribution succeeded.  These observations show different paths behave differently; they do not establish a backend outage.  Infisical sync observations belong to peer PR #309.  Enabled telemetry does not prove Sentry delivery.

## Remaining Priorities

The next source priorities are paired-companion profile permissions (#93), explicit ACP/Codex resume failures (#280), ACP deadlines (#281), renderer hydration/save feedback (#266/#267), and reliable integration readiness (#269–#272).  DSH (#188), Antigravity routing (#283), and failed iOS settings saves (#293) have adjacent seat ownership and should be coordinated there.  Room Stop is a distinct new issue (#310), and documentation-only CI cost is tracked in #318 with current verification rules preserved.  Signed updater/feed verification and end-to-end phone, tunnel, RAG, Composio, Sentry, and PagerDuty checks remain acceptance work.

## Coordination

Each implementation lane has owned Mac board items, GitHub issues, and effort-log entries.  Close only the findings implemented by that lane after its green merge, with the actual merge commit.  The living owner note is `[BF, Codex] Audit fixes and implementation` in Coding.  Reusable lessons were contributed through fleet recall; the failed MCP attempt was not forced into a duplicate contribution.
