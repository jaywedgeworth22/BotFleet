# Observability (Sentry)

BotFleet reports crashes, errors, and a sample of performance traces to
Sentry (`jays-services/botfleet`) from five surfaces: the Mac harness, the
Electron desktop renderer, the iOS TestFlight app, the public desktop
releases (macOS/Windows/Ubuntu installers built by CI), and a local desktop
package built by hand on the owner's Mac.  Every surface is off unless a DSN
reaches it — there is no shipped default, and none has ever been in source.

## Where the DSN lives

- **Infisical prod (canonical).**  `SENTRY_DSN` and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` live in
  the BotFleet project, `env=prod`, `path=/`.  These two names are the source
  of truth; every CI workflow resolves from here first.
- **GitHub Actions secret (synced copy).**  `SENTRY_DSN` on
  `jaywedgeworth22/BotFleet` is a fallback for when a workflow's Infisical
  login fails (CLI install hiccup, a rotated machine identity, and so on).
  It is read only from step `env:`, never from an `if:` condition — GitHub's
  dispatch parser rejects `secrets.*` inside `if:` with an HTTP 422 (the same
  failure class as DealDex #175 and Usage-Monitor #1343).
- **`~/.botfleet/config.json`** `observability.sentryDsn` is where the Mac
  harness gets its DSN.  Set it from Settings → Observability in the app, or
  with one loopback `PATCH /api/config` (see below) — never by hand-editing
  the file while the harness is running.
- **Never in source.**  PR #108 removed a hardcoded DSN from the iOS app; only
  environment variable names and config keys appear in this repository.  A
  `grep -r` for `ingest.sentry.io` in tracked files should turn up nothing but
  this document and code comments referencing the name.

## Precedence and the kill switch

The Mac harness resolves, in order:

1. `process.env.SENTRY_DSN` or `process.env.BOTFLEET_SENTRY_DSN` — source
   `env`.  An operator (CI, a LaunchAgent `EnvironmentVariables` block) can
   pin a value this way; Settings shows the DSN field disabled with "Set by
   the environment on this computer" and the source reads "Environment".
2. `~/.botfleet/config.json` `observability.sentryDsn` — source `config`.
   This is the normal path: set it once from Settings → Observability.
3. Nothing configured — source `none`.  The boot log prints
   `[sentry] disabled: no DSN configured (set one in Settings > Observability)`
   and nothing is sent.

The kill switch is explicit, not implicit.  A DSN being present is not enough
to silently start reporting forever, and it is not enough to silently stop
either:

- `observability.enabled` **absent** → Sentry runs (opt-out, matching
  `ingress.enabled`).
- `observability.enabled: false` → Sentry stops immediately, no restart
  needed.  The boot line and the `GET /api/observability` status both say so.
- `observability.tracesSampleRate: 0` stops performance traces only, and is
  reported as `traces=0` in the boot line — not silently defaulted back to
  the normal sampling rate.

Changing any of these through `PATCH /api/config` takes effect live: the
harness tears down the running Sentry client (`Sentry.close()`, fire-and-
forget, never blocking the request) and re-initializes against the new
settings in the same process.

## Settings → Observability

The desktop app's Settings has an **Observability** section ("Diagnostics &
Error Reporting") next to Usage Monitor.  It shows a status pill (host only,
never the full DSN), the environment, the source ("Settings" / "Environment"
/ "None"), the traces sample rate, and whether warnings/errors are forwarded
as Sentry Logs.  **Save** stores the DSN on this computer and applies it
immediately; **Send Test Event** creates one real event in the Sentry project
so you can confirm delivery.  Leaving the DSN field blank on Save keeps the
value already stored — there is no accidental-wipe path.  Clearing the DSN
is a separate, explicit "Remove Diagnostics Key" action.

Prompts, transcripts, and tool arguments are never sent to Sentry from any
surface.

## The two HTTP routes

Both live in the same loopback-only block as `/api/telemetry/*` — no extra
auth beyond the existing loopback gate and origin check.

```
GET /api/observability
```

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "configured": true,
  "source": "config",
  "host": "o123.ingest.sentry.io",
  "projectId": "456",
  "environment": "production",
  "tracesSampleRate": 0.2,
  "logsEnabled": true,
  "profilingAvailable": false,
  "totalCaptured": 12,
  "lastEventAt": "2026-09-08T12:00:00.000Z",
  "lastError": null,
  "dsn": "https://abc123@o123.ingest.sentry.io/456"
}
```

The full DSN is included here on purpose: the desktop renderer cannot start
the browser SDK without it, and the same value already ships publicly in
botfleet.app's built HTML.  `GET /api/config`, by contrast, only ever adds
`hasDsn` and `host` under its `observability` block — never the DSN itself —
because that frame is broadcast to every open window and, with Remote Access
on, over the tunnel.

```
POST /api/observability/test
```

```json
{ "ok": true, "error": null, "eventId": "9f1c2b3a4d5e6f708192a3b4c5d6e7f8" }
```

On an unconfigured install this returns `{ "ok": false, "error": "Set a
Sentry DSN first.", "eventId": null }` without touching the SDK.

```
PATCH /api/config
```

```json
{ "observability": { "sentryDsn": "https://abc123@o123.ingest.sentry.io/456", "enabled": true, "environment": "production", "tracesSampleRate": 0.2, "logsEnabled": true } }
```

Every field is optional and merges into the stored config; an empty string
for `sentryDsn` clears it (the only way to clear it over the API — omitting
the field leaves the stored value untouched).

## How each surface gets its DSN

1. **Mac harness** (`com.jay.botfleet-server`).  Resolution order above.
   Boot line on success:
   `[sentry] enabled (config) env=production traces=0.2 logs=on host=o123.ingest.sentry.io project=456`.
   The DSN's key and the full DSN string never reach a log line, an error
   message, or a broadcast frame.
2. **Desktop renderer** (`/Applications/BotFleet.app`).  Two paths, either
   sufficient on its own: a build-time `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` inlined by Vite (see
   "public desktop releases" and "local packaging" below), or a runtime
   fallback that fetches `GET /api/observability` from the attached harness
   over the same `api()` helper the Settings UI uses, and initializes Sentry
   from the response when the harness reports one configured and enabled.
3. **iOS TestFlight.**  `.github/workflows/ios-ship.yml`'s "Load Infisical
   signing secrets" step also resolves `SENTRY_DSN`: Infisical prod first,
   then the GitHub Actions secret (`GH_FALLBACK_SENTRY_DSN`, read from step
   `env:`, never from `if:`).  Empty after both prints
   `::warning::SENTRY_DSN is empty after the Infisical prod export and the
   GitHub secret fallback.  This TestFlight build ships with Sentry Cocoa
   inert.` and the ship continues — a missing DSN never fails a TestFlight
   upload.  `scripts/ios-fleet/ship-testflight.sh` logs the same condition
   locally and, under `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, emits its own `::warning::` too.
4. **Public desktop releases** (`release.yml`'s `mac` / `windows` / `linux`
   jobs, plus the standalone `package-win.yml` and `package-linux.yml`
   workflows).  Each package job runs a "Resolve the Sentry DSN" step before
   its `pnpm package:*` step: Infisical prod for both `SENTRY_DSN` and
   `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, the GitHub secret as `SENTRY_DSN`'s fallback, and
   `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` copied from whichever `SENTRY_DSN` resolved to when
   Infisical has no `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` entry of its own.  Both are masked and
   written to `GITHUB_ENV`, which puts them in the environment of the later
   `pnpm package:*` step on the CI runner.

   That lights up the **renderer only**.  Vite inlines `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` into
   the bundle at build time, so a public release ships with the browser SDK
   already pointed at the project.  The **harness gets nothing baked in**:
   `server/sentry.ts` reads `process.env.SENTRY_DSN` at run time, inside the
   forked `server/index.js` child process on the end user's machine, whose
   environment comes from whatever the OS hands the installed app — not from
   a `GITHUB_ENV` write on a build machine.  Nothing in `package.json`'s
   `package:*` scripts, in electron-builder, or in `electron/main.mjs` copies
   a non-`VITE_`-prefixed variable into the installed app.  On a fresh
   install `SENTRY_DSN` is simply absent, and the harness reports
   `source: none` until somebody sets a DSN in Settings > Observability (the
   `config` tier) or in that machine's own environment — the same as any
   other install.  A total resolution failure warns and continues — it never
   fails the build.
5. **Local desktop packaging.**  `scripts/with-sentry-dsn.sh` wraps a local
   `pnpm package:mac:local` (or any other `package:*` script) with the same
   three-tier resolution — already-exported environment, Infisical (only if
   already logged in; this script never calls `infisical login`), then the
   handoff file `~/.secrets/botfleet-sentry.env` via
   `grep -m1 '^NAME=' | cut -d= -f2-` — and exports both `SENTRY_DSN` and
   `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` before executing the wrapped command.  It never prints a
   resolved value.  Usage:

   ```bash
   scripts/with-sentry-dsn.sh pnpm package:mac:local
   ```

## What is intentionally out of scope

- A second Sentry project — everything lands in `jays-services/botfleet`.
- `@sentry/profiling-node` — not installed; `profilingAvailable` reports
  `false` and the harness warns once rather than silently no-oping.
- `ios/App/SentryTelemetry.swift` and `ios/project.yml` already handle an
  empty DSN and are unchanged by any of this.
