# Secrets And Infisical

BotFleet can resolve its provider keys, tokens and URLs from an external
secret store — Infisical — instead of (or on top of) the values already
living on this computer.  It is entirely optional: an install that has never
been pointed at a project keeps working exactly as it always has, with
nothing new to configure and no new chrome in Settings.

This document is the map: where a credential can live, which one wins,
what the boot line and the two status surfaces say, and the refusal
BotFleet gives instead of silently reverting a save.

## Where Each Credential Lives

- **Infisical (canonical, when connected).**  An operator who wants one
  store of record for a fleet of installs points BotFleet at a project —
  environment `prod`, path `/` by default.  That project is the owner's own
  store; nothing ships a default project, so no two installs share a key
  unless the same operator deliberately connected both to the same one.
- **`~/.botfleet/config.json`** (or `$OMB_DATA_DIR/config.json`) and the OS
  keychain are where a single desktop install's own copy of each value
  lives.  This is still the primary store for an install that has no
  Infisical project configured, and it is where the desktop shell puts a
  credential entered in Settings.
- **GitHub Actions secrets** are a synced fallback for CI only.  Each
  workflow tries Infisical first and falls back to a same-named
  `GH_FALLBACK_<NAME>` step env var sourced from a GitHub secret, so a
  workflow keeps running green through an Infisical outage or a not-yet-
  seeded name.
- **Never in source.**  No credential this document names has ever been
  hardcoded in this repository; a `grep -r` for a real value should turn up
  nothing but this file's field names and the code that resolves them.

## Precedence

For a name Infisical holds, **Infisical wins** — over both this computer's
`config.json` and the process environment.  Underneath that, the ordering
BotFleet already had is untouched:

1. **Infisical** — a non-empty value for the field's Infisical name in the
   configured project/environment/path.
2. **Environment or file**, in whichever order that particular field already
   used before Infisical existed (`loadConfig()`'s hand-written overlay puts
   the environment above the file for a handful of legacy names; every other
   mapped field is read fresh from `config.json` and, at each call site that
   already checked an environment variable, falls back to it the same way it
   always did).
3. **None** — nothing configured anywhere; the feature that reads this field
   is simply off.

Only a name in the map below is ever applied, and a resolved value lands in
the in-memory config object only — never in `process.env` — so nothing new
rides into a spawned engine CLI.  A row in the vault under a name this table
does not recognize (`PATH`, `NODE_ENV`, a typo) is reported as
**"In Infisical, not used by BotFleet"** and otherwise ignored.

## The Kill Switch And The Boot Line

`infisical.enabled` is explicit both ways, matching `ingress.enabled` and
`observability.enabled`:

- **Absent** → on, once a project id and a machine identity are both
  present.  Connecting a project is the deliberate act; nothing else is
  required to start using it.
- **`false`** → off immediately.  The snapshot is cleared, every mapped
  field re-resolves from the environment and the file, and nothing restarts.

Absent an explicit Settings save, an install checks Infisical every 15
minutes (`refreshMinutes`, 5–1440), against site `https://app.infisical.com`,
environment `prod`, path `/`.

The server log line takes one of five forms, names and counts only —
never a value:

```
[infisical] enabled env=prod path=/ vault=9 applied=4 fields=composio.apiKey,usage.ingestUrl,usage.ingestToken,usage.readToken unused=5 ms=412
[infisical] disabled: not configured (add a machine identity in Settings > Secrets)
[infisical] disabled by settings
[infisical] unavailable: <redacted error>; using environment and config values
[infisical] credentials changed (timer): xai.key — Sync Now or save Settings to rebuild bots
```

The last form is a **timer** refresh only: a scheduled sync that finds a
changed provider key never rebuilds a running bot on its own.  It records
the change and waits for an explicit **Sync Now** or a Settings save — both
user-initiated — before any provider is reloaded.  A field that does not
require a rebuild to take effect (the voice key, the usage tokens, the DSN)
never produces this line at all.

Boot itself cannot hang on Infisical: the initial fetch is bounded (8
seconds per call, 12 seconds overall by default, overridable with
`OMB_INFISICAL_BOOT_TIMEOUT_MS`) and always resolves one way or the other.
A boot-time failure falls back to the environment and file values with the
error recorded; a later refresh failure keeps the last good snapshot and
marks it stale, so a network blip never swaps credentials out from under a
running fleet.

This table lives once, in code, at `server/secret-map.ts`'s `SECRET_FIELDS` —
this list is kept in step with it by hand, so treat the source as
authoritative if the two ever disagree.

**Deliberately not mapped:** MiniMax (no config section — `MINIMAX_API_KEY`
or `~/.mmx/config.json` only), the Composio managed-broker pair (provisioned
per install over its own live IPC channel), the Remote Access connector
token (Electron-only), `instances[].environment`, and `OMB_COMMS_TOKEN` /
`OMB_CONTROL_TOKEN` (random per boot).  None of these can be usefully shared
through a vault, so none of them is in the table above.

## Refusal And Write-Through

Saving a field through Settings while Infisical holds that name is either
refused or written through — **never accepted and then silently reverted by
the next sync.**

- **Write Through off (the default).**  `PATCH /api/config` touching a
  vault-managed field returns **409** and saves nothing:

  ```json
  {
    "error": "<Field> is managed by Infisical (prod).  Change it in Infisical, or turn on Write Through in Settings > Secrets.",
    "field": "usage.ingestToken",
    "infisicalName": "USAGE_MONITOR_INGEST_TOKEN"
  }
  ```

- **Write Through on.**  The new value is written to Infisical first; only
  once that succeeds is the local copy blanked to `""`, so the vault stays
  the one canonical copy.  A failed write reaches the caller as a 502 and
  nothing is saved locally either.
- **Clearing a vault-managed field is always refused**, in both modes — "Remove
  it in Infisical." — because an empty local value can never mean "delete
  this from the vault."  Write-through never deletes.

## The Three HTTP Routes

All three are loopback-only, in the same block as `/api/telemetry/*` — the
existing loopback gate and origin check apply, and Remote Access can tunnel
them to an authenticated session but never to the open internet.

```
GET  /api/infisical/status
```

Returns `{ infisical: InfisicalStatusView, fields: FieldRow[] }` — booleans,
counts, names and ids.  `fields` walks the secret map; a `secret: true`
field's `value` is always `null`, never the real value.

```
POST /api/infisical/sync
```

Refreshes from the vault (`refresh("manual")`), re-resolves every mapped
field, reloads any provider whose credentials actually changed, and returns
the same payload `GET /api/infisical/status` would.  This is what the
Secrets card's **Sync Now** button calls.

```
POST /api/infisical/test
```

Logs in and lists secret **names** only (`viewSecretValue=false` on the
wire) — proves the identity and project id are correct without ever
populating the snapshot.  Returns `{ ok, error, secretCount, names }`.  This
is what **Test Connection** calls.

`GET /api/config` separately carries a small `infisical` block —
`configured`, `enabled`, `writeThrough`, `environment`, `hasClientSecret`,
`managedCount`, `lastSyncAt`, `stale`, `hasError`, `pendingProviderReload` —
because that frame is broadcast to every open window; the project id, site
URL and vault names live only on the loopback status route above.

## CI: The Composite Action

`.github/actions/infisical-secrets` wraps `scripts/infisical-fetch.mjs`, a
dependency-free Node script — no SDK, no CLI install — so the same action
runs unmodified on `macos-latest`, `windows-latest` and `ubuntu-24.04`
GitHub-hosted runners.  A workflow step passes `names`, an optional
`required` subset, the project id, environment, secret path and the
identity, plus a `GH_FALLBACK_<NAME>` env entry per name it wants a GitHub
secret to cover:

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/infisical-secrets
  with:
    names: SENTRY_DSN SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
    required: SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
    project-id: ${{ secrets.INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID }}
    client-id: ${{ secrets.INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID }}
    client-secret: ${{ secrets.INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET }}
  env:
    GH_FALLBACK_SENTRY_DSN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_DSN }}
```

Each resolved value is masked (`::add-mask::`) and exported into
`$GITHUB_ENV` before the step ever logs anything else.  A name that is
empty from both Infisical and its `GH_FALLBACK_<NAME>` produces a
`::warning::` unless it is in `required`, in which case the job fails with
`::error::`.  `secrets.*` is never referenced inside an `if:` condition —
GitHub's dispatch parser rejects that with an HTTP 422.

## A Headless Install's Own Identity

The automation machine identity is the one pair of credentials that cannot
resolve through the vault it unlocks — a lock cannot hold its own key.  A
headless Mac harness gets it one of two ways:

- **Environment**, at process start: `INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID` (alias
  `INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`), `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET` (alias
  `INFISICAL_UNIVERSAL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`), `INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID`,
  `INFISICAL_SITE_URL` (alias `INFISICAL_DOMAIN`), `INFISICAL_ENVIRONMENT`,
  `INFISICAL_SECRET_PATH`.  The alias pairs mirror the names CI already
  uses, so one identity works unmodified in both places.
- **One loopback `PATCH /api/config`**, before Settings → Secrets exists or
  in place of it.

  The client secret reads every secret in the project, which makes it the
  single worst value in this design to put on a command line.  Anything in
  `argv` is readable from `ps` by every process on the machine — including
  any tool a bot spawns — for as long as the request runs, and the whole
  command is appended to `~/.zsh_history` forever.  So the values go from a
  `chmod 600` handoff file into shell variables that are never echoed, the
  body goes into a `umask 077` temp file, and `curl` reads the body from that
  file rather than from its own arguments:

  ```bash
  umask 077                                   # the temp file below is 0600
  BODY="$(mktemp -t botfleet-infisical)"
  # Read from a chmod 600 handoff file into variables.  `-m1 … | cut` keeps
  # the match out of the terminal: no line of that file is ever printed.
  CLIENT_ID="$(grep -m1 '^INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID=' "$HANDOFF_FILE" | cut -d= -f2-)"
  CLIENT_SECRET="$(grep -m1 '^INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET=' "$HANDOFF_FILE" | cut -d= -f2-)"
  # jq reads both values out of its own ENVIRONMENT and does the JSON quoting,
  # so neither ever appears in an argument list, and the body only ever
  # exists in the 0600 file.
  PROJECT_ID=your-project-id CLIENT_ID="$CLIENT_ID" CLIENT_SECRET="$CLIENT_SECRET" \
    jq -n '{infisical:{projectId:env.PROJECT_ID,environment:"prod",clientId:env.CLIENT_ID,clientSecret:env.CLIENT_SECRET}}' \
    > "$BODY"
  curl -s -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8799/api/config \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    --data-binary @"$BODY"
  rm -P "$BODY"
  unset CLIENT_ID CLIENT_SECRET
  ```

  `$HANDOFF_FILE` is whatever `chmod 600` file holds the pair on that
  machine; never open it, `cat` it, or grep it in a way that prints a whole
  line.
  Never a hand edit of `~/.botfleet/config.json` while the harness is
  running, and never a value inline in the `--data-binary` argument.

The product server **never** reads a fleet secrets-handoff file itself —
only these two paths feed it an identity — and `server/secret-map.ts` has
no `infisical.*` row for exactly the reason above: the vault's own
credentials cannot be one of the things the vault resolves.

## The Migration Script

`scripts/infisical-migrate.mjs` is a one-way seeding helper an operator runs
by hand — nothing in the product calls it.  It reads the same config
`loadConfig()` would (`~/.botfleet/config.json` or `$OMB_DATA_DIR`), walks
the secret map, and for every field with a non-empty local value reports
whether Infisical already holds that name and whether the value matches, by
comparing sha256 digests — never the raw values:

```
$ node --experimental-strip-types scripts/infisical-migrate.mjs
Infisical prod at / on https://app.infisical.com (dry run -- pass --apply to write):
  composio.apiKey -> COMPOSIO_API_KEY  (local value present, vault: absent)
  usage.ingestUrl -> USAGE_MONITOR_INGEST_URL  (local value present, vault: absent)
  usage.ingestToken -> USAGE_MONITOR_INGEST_TOKEN  (local value present, vault: absent)
  usage.readToken -> USAGE_READ_TOKEN  (local value present, vault: absent)
```

**Dry run is the default and prints only this report.**  `--apply` upserts
every row not already `present-and-same`, one name at a time, printing
`wrote NAME`, `skipped NAME (unchanged)`, or `failed NAME: <redacted
error>`.  It never touches `~/.secrets/*` or any other handoff file — the
identity comes from `infisical.*` in the config file or from
`INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID` / `INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET` in the environment, the
same two paths described above — and it never accepts a credential as a
command-line argument or prints one to the console.
