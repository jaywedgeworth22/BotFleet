// Keeping secrets out of the native protocol log — and out of the transcript.
//
// The native tee writes every provider message verbatim, which is what makes
// protocol drift diagnosable — but the messages that set a session up carry
// the credentials the agent is handed: the box token and the comms token
// travel inside `session/new`'s mcpServers env, and a Composio consumer key
// travels in an MCP header.  Those logs sit in ~/.botfleet/native as
// ordinary files, are read by anyone debugging, and get pasted into issues.
//
// So the log keeps the SHAPE and loses the VALUES: a redacted entry still
// tells you a token was passed, under which name, and how long it was —
// enough to debug "the proxy got no token" without the token being there.
//
// This lives in `shared/` rather than `server/` because the other caller is
// `shared/tool-activity.ts`, which clips a tool result down to one line for
// the transcript — and that clip has to happen AFTER redaction, not before
// (see the truncation note below).  `server/redact.ts` re-exports both
// entry points, so every existing server importer is unaffected.
//
// Truncation is the reason these patterns are shaped the way they are.  A
// secret that has been cut in half upstream has lost the closing marker a
// naive pattern anchors on — the `END … PRIVATE KEY` trailer, a JWT's third
// segment, a quoted value's closing quote.  Redacting before the clip is the
// real fix; recognising the truncated shapes is the belt to that braces,
// because the detail also arrives pre-clipped on paths we do not own.

// ("Basic authentication requires…", "Token expired yesterday"); the same
// word behind this header name cannot be prose.  The scheme is kept, so the
// line still says what kind of credential went out.
//
// The value runs to the END of the header value, not to the end of the first
// token, because a structured credential carries its secret in a LATER part:
// SigV4 signs with `…, Signature=<secret>` after two harmless parameters, and
// Digest's own parameters are comma-separated and individually quoted.  The
// value therefore crosses commas and semicolons.
//
// Where it STOPS is decided by CONTEXT — by how the value was introduced —
// and not by scanning forward for pairs of quotes.  That is why there are two
// patterns below rather than one.  A single pattern that stepped over
// balanced quote pairs had to answer both questions at once, and got each of
// them wrong in the other's direction: it needed a length cap on the quoted
// part so that a serialized object's siblings were not eaten, and that same
// cap is what let an OAuth `oauth_signature` longer than the cap end the
// match early and ship the signature into the transcript and into Sentry.
// Asking how the value was introduced answers both at once.

/** An authorization value INTRODUCED BY A QUOTE — the JSON and config
 * spelling, `"authorization": "Bearer …"` or `authorization='…'`.
 *
 * The quote that opened it is what ends it, so the value runs to the matching
 * close, crosses no quote at all, and takes no length cap.  Nothing past that
 * quote is touched, which is the whole point: a one-line serialized object
 * carries `,"status":"ok","message":"…"` after the header key, and those
 * siblings used to be eaten by the balanced-quote scan and were then
 * permanently missing from stored bot text and from failure details.
 *
 * A backslash escape is stepped over rather than mistaken for the close, so
 * a quote inside the string does not end the value early.  The two branches
 * are disjoint on their first character (one requires a backslash, the other
 * forbids it), which is what keeps this linear on a string that never
 * closes.
 *
 * END OF TEXT closes it too, because a value whose closing quote was clipped
 * away upstream has no other end left.  That fallback fires only where the
 * run really did reach the end — a quote of its own kind would have stopped
 * it first — so it can never be the path a terminated value takes, and the
 * siblings are still safe.  It is the one shape `KEY_VALUE_UNTERMINATED`
 * cannot reach: OAuth and Digest write ESCAPED quotes inside the value, and
 * that pattern's value class stops at the first quote of any kind. */

/** A BARE authorization value — an HTTP header line as `curl -v`, an access
 * log, or an echoed stderr line prints it.
 *
 * Nothing closes this one but the line, so it runs to the end of the line and
 * crosses quoted parameters of ANY length.  That length is the whole defect
 * this replaces: OAuth hides its secret in `oauth_signature="…344 chars…"`
 * and SigV4 in a trailing `Signature=…`, and any cap on the quoted part ends
 * the match before either of them and leaves the signature in the clear.
 *
 * "The line" means the line the credential is on, which is not always the
 * line the header name is on: a FOLDED header (RFC 7230 obs-fold, and what
 * a pretty-printer produces) puts the break between the scheme and the
 * credential, `Digest\n  username="…", response="<secret>"`.  That is why
 * the separator after the scheme is `\s+` and not horizontal whitespace —
 * restricting it leaves the bare pattern looking at a six-character
 * `Digest` and declining, and no later pattern knows what the continuation
 * line is.
 *
 * Which quotes on that line belong to the value is decided the same way —
 * by context, and the context is not on the header line at all.  A quote in
 * a header value is just a character; the only quote that must survive is
 * the one WRAPPING the header, `curl -H "…"`, and that quote announced
 * itself before the header name.  So the value runs to the end of its line
 * and is then cut at the wrapper's closing quote if a wrapper was open —
 * see `wrapperQuoteAt`, which asks how that quote OPENED to know a delimiter
 * from prose, which nesting level it belongs to, and whether the text around
 * it is escaped — and at nothing else.
 *
 * That is the third answer this pattern has had, and the first that is a
 * rule rather than a guess.  Reading the value's own quotes to find its end
 * cannot work, because nothing on the line distinguishes a parameter's quote
 * from a wrapper's: `oauth_signature="…"` and a `Basic` credential whose
 * base64 padding leaves an `=` in front of the wrapper look identical, `\"`
 * is the parameter's delimiter inside a shell argument and an escape inside
 * it on a raw line, and a clipped parameter and a terminal wrapper both end
 * the text.  Every one of those was a real leak or a real over-mask found
 * against a version of this pattern that tried to tell them apart locally.
 * Asking who opened the quote answers all of them at once, and asking it
 * OUTSIDE the value is what makes the answer available. */

 *
 * Looks only BEFORE the header name, on its own line, because that is where a
 * wrapper announces itself and it is the one thing the value cannot tell you
 * about itself.  Three things make the answer trustworthy:
 *
 * ADJACENCY is the whole test, and it is the whole implementation too: the
 * argument that wraps a header opens immediately in front of it, whitespace
 * apart, so the wrapper is simply the quote you find by stepping backwards
 * over blanks.  `-H "…`, `-H'…`, `-H"…` (shell quoting may start mid-word),
 * `\"…` one escaping level up, and a log line's `sent header "<header>: …"`
 * all qualify.
 *
 * A quote with text between it and the header name wraps something else, or
 * nothing at all — `size=2"; <header>: …`, `he said "wat; <header>: …` — and
 * cutting the value there leaves a stub and hands the credential back in the
 * clear.  An apostrophe in `it's` is harmless for the same reason.  An
 * adjacent quote that CLOSES rather than opens does the same damage
 * (`curl "prefix"<header>: …`), and counting the ones before it at the same
 * escape level says which it is.
 *
 * Adjacency is what lets this NOT parse shell quoting, which is the part
 * that cannot be got right from one line of text: tracking open quotes with
 * a stack has to decide whether the `'` in `echo "it's ready"` is a nested
 * opener or a literal, and whether the `"` inside `bash -c '…'` is a literal
 * or the inner shell's delimiter.  Both readings are correct at some level
 * and each one breaks the other's case.  The quote in front of the header is
 * the header's delimiter whichever level it belongs to, so the question
 * never has to be answered.
 *
 * And a wrapper carries its ESCAPING LEVEL, because the text may already be
 * quoted once over — a driver that hands us `curl -H \"<header>: …\" <url>`

/** How much of a bare header value is the credential: everything up to the
 * wrapper's closing quote, or all of it when nothing wrapped the header.
 *
 * The closing quote is the one written at the wrapper's OWN escaping level,
 * which is why the backslash run has to match exactly rather than merely be
 * odd or even.  A command serialized one level up wraps with `\"` and writes
 * its own quoted parameters `\\\"` — three backslashes, the next level in —
 * and stopping at one of those masks through `oauth_signature=\\` and leaves
 * the signature standing.
 *
 * And the FIRST such quote either closes the argument or the wrapper was
 * never real.  A closing quote is followed by whitespace, by the end of the
 * line, or by a shell separator — a redirection counts, because bash reads
 * `-H "…">trace.log` as an operator and the quote really did close there,
 * and so does a `$` expansion or another quote, because bash glues an
 * adjacent quoted and unquoted run into one word.  A quote followed by an
 * ordinary LETTER is the one shape that stays disqualifying, even though
 * bash would glue that too: `realm="public"` looks exactly like it, and
 * accepting it puts the parameters after the cut back in the clear.  The
 * cost is over-masking a `-H "…"suffix` tail, which loses context and no
 * secret; a quote followed by ordinary text opened
 * something instead, which means the quote in front of the header was not an
 * argument's opener after all and every rule above it was reasoning about
 * the wrong thing.  There is no salvaging a later candidate in that case —
 * cutting at one would leave the parameters before it in the clear — so the
 * whole line's value is masked, which loses a reader some context and loses
 * no secret.
 *
 * A `$` or backtick right behind the quote is not automatically that closing
 * quote either — it is the START of a glued, unquoted run, and bash keeps
 * gluing: an OAuth/Digest-style value can toggle the SAME quote back on for
 * its next field instead of escaping — `realm="$REALM", oauth_signature="…"`
 * is one continuous `-H` argument (confirmed against bash 5.2.21) — and the
 * quote right before `$REALM` is indistinguishable, on its own, from the
 * wrapper's real close.  So a `$`/backtick run is walked forward rather than
 * trusted: if it runs into whitespace or a separator with no further quote of
 * this wrapper's kind, the word really did end at the quote that introduced
 * the run, exactly as `-H "…token…"$SUFFIX <url>` needs.  If it runs into
 * ANOTHER quote of this wrapper's kind first, the value was never closed at
 * all — quoting merely toggled off and back on — so that quote is not a
 * candidate close either; scanning resumes past it, looking for whichever
 * quote closes THAT segment, so a later field like `oauth_signature` is not
 * left standing past a requote that looked like the end.
 *
 * That forward scan for a requote does not run unbounded, though: bash only
 * keeps a `$`/backtick run GLUED to what follows while nothing separates
 * them, and a shell-word boundary — whitespace, `&&`, `;`, `|` — ends the
 * word right there whether or not a same-type quote shows up later on the
 * line.  Scanning past that boundary anyway is what let an unrelated later
 * command, `"…token…"$SUFFIX https://example.com && echo "done"`, be read as
 * one continuous value all the way to `"done"`'s closing quote — the search
 * has to stop at the boundary and treat the run as ended right there, the
 * same as if no further quote existed at all.
 *
 * A boundary inside a NESTED EXPANSION is not a boundary, though — command
 * substitution replaces the whole `$(…)` with its output before the shell
 * word is assembled, so whitespace between its parens never splits the word:
 * `realm="$(printf zone)", oauth_signature=<secret>"` is one `-H` argument
 * (confirmed against bash 5.2.21), and stopping at the space inside `$(…)`
 * left `oauth_signature` standing past a boundary that was never real.  So
 * `$(` is walked to its balanced `)` — tracking depth, because the command
 * itself may contain nested parens — as one atomic span with no boundary
 * check inside it, and a backtick run is walked the same way to its matching
 * backtick.  Both walks consume the run in one linear pass with no
 * backtracking, so this stays O(n) on a pathological line.
 *
 * A paren INSIDE A QUOTE, inside that same `$(…)`, does not change the
 * depth either — bash parses a quoted or escaped `)` as part of the
 * substituted command, not as the substitution's own close
 * (`$(printf ') value')` is one substitution whose argument happens to
 * contain a literal `)`).  Counting it anyway closed the span early and
 * left the space right after it looking like a real boundary again, the
 * same failure this depth tracking exists to prevent — just one quoting
 * level deeper.  So the depth walk keeps its own miniature quote state:
 * a `'`/`"` toggles it, a backslash steps over the character after it
 * (outside single quotes, where bash never treats backslash as an escape
 * at all), and `(`/`)` only move `depth` while no quote is open.
 *
 * A backslash-escaped character glues to the run the same way, and outside
 * any expansion at all: `realm="$REALM\ value", oauth_signature=<secret>"`
 * is one `-H` argument (confirmed against bash 5.2.21) because the escaped
 * space is preserved literally rather than ending the shell word.  So the
 * lookahead steps over any `\`-prefixed character as a single atomic unit
 * before testing for a boundary — the same "consume it whole, do not let a
 * character inside it decide anything on its own" treatment `$(…)` and a
 * backtick span already get.
 *
 * `$'…'`, `${…}`, and `<(…)`/`>(…)` glue on the same way, each for its own
 * reason.  `$'foo bar'` (ANSI-C quoting) is QUOTED syntax — bash processes
 * its own backslash escapes inside it, so `\'` is a literal quote rather
 * than the close — and is walked to its own matching quote, not treated as
 * a balanced span.  `${REALM:-'foo bar'}` (parameter expansion) shares the
 * quote-aware balancing `$(…)` uses, just brace-delimited instead of
 * paren-delimited — its fallback/pattern operators can carry quoted
 * whitespace of their own.  `<(list)`/`>(list)` (process substitution) is
 * replaced by a filename before the word is assembled, same as `$(…)` is
 * replaced by output, and is walked with the identical `walkBalancedSpan`
 * this shares with `$(…)` and `${…}`.  A BARE `<`/`>` not followed by `(`
 * is still a real redirection and keeps closing the argument the way it
 * always has — only the paren-bearing form is treated as an expansion at
 * all, so this cannot swallow a genuine `-H "…"><url` the way accepting
 * every `<`/`>` would.
 *
 * An empty INLINE parameter needs the identical requote treatment for a
 * reason that has nothing to do with `$` or backticks: `realm=""` opens and
 * closes the SAME quote with nothing between, which is exactly how bash
 * glues a quoted segment back onto a following one — `realm="$REALM"` does
 * it with a variable in the gap, `realm=""` does it with an empty gap.  Read
 * as an ordinary "does this close" test, though, the adjacent closing quote
 * of the empty pair looks identical to a wrapper's TRUE close glued to a new
 * quoted shell word (`"…token…""more"`, tested below) — the only thing that
 * tells them apart is what precedes the opening quote.  A parameter only
 * opens behind `=` (RFC 7235 auth-param); a wrapper's own close is not, so
 * gating on that keeps `"…token…""more"` stopping where it always did while
 * `realm=""` is treated as a requote and the scan keeps going — which is
 * what stops an unrelated same-type literal earlier on the line (a poisoned
 * opener count) from landing the cut on `realm=` and shipping whatever
 * credential field comes after it. */

 *
 * Shared by every expansion form that glues onto the shell word this way,
