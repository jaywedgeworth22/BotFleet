/** How the workspace is laid out.  Bots, rooms, and tasks stay the same
 * records; this setting changes what the roster is for.
 *
 * - `simple` — Grok-style.  Named bots, one conversation each.  Rooms are
 *   group threads: one shared conversation per room that invited bots and
 *   the user write in.  Extra bot tasks stay saved but stay hidden.
 * - `projects` — Claude / Codex / Antigravity style.  No named bots.  The
 *   same custom room word is a category, and any number of threads can sit
 *   under it.  Each thread can carry its own model and fallbacks.
 *   Incoming webhooks, resource samples, and schedules each reuse one
 *   thread of that type per category.
 *
 * They are not the same feature with two labels.  The room-terminology
 * setting only names them (Channel, Group, Project, or a custom pair).
 *
 * Absent on disk means `simple`.  A leftover `fleet` value from an earlier
 * draft is read as `projects`.
